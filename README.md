- This project is a web scraper that is design specifically for use with wikipedia

SETUP
- download the code from github
- go into the "Scraper.py" file and run it
- after you hit run, it should start a local server that you can access from the terminal
- It should say something like: Running on http://111.1.1.1:5000 (with different numbers)
- click on that and it should open the scraper UI in your browser
- from there, setup is complete, you may now use the scaper, hit CTRL + C in your terminal to terminate the program

USING THE SCRAPER
- As a user you will need to have the url of a wikipedia page to start from
- Enter that url into the text box and hit the "scrape" button
- From there the iframe below should navigate to the page you entered
- After the iframe navigates to your page, you may hit the "randomize" button 
    to follow a random link found in that article. This is repeatable
    (You may also click a link in the iframe to follow a specific link)
